Parasite-Organism coevolution model based on that described in W.D. Hamilton et. al. [Sexual reproduction as an adaptation to resist parasites](http://www.pnas.org/content/87/9/3566.full.pdf). Utilizes fast-mutating parasites and slow-mutating host organisms to evaluate fitness of a certain biological model within the organism.

The current implementation explores the advantage of organisms choosing mates with a more diverse Major Histocompatibility Complex genome under the pressure of constantly evolving Parasites.
